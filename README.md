# CSS calc() Unexpected Calculation Results

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS. The expected calculation results are not being produced when combining different units and other CSS properties.

## Bug Description
The CSS `calc()` function provides unexpected results when a combination of units (e.g., pixels and percentages) or when combined with other CSS properties is involved. The calculated value differs significantly from the anticipated result.

## Steps to Reproduce
1.  Examine the `bug.css` file for the buggy code.
2.  Apply this stylesheet to an HTML element.
3.  Observe the rendered element's dimensions or other affected properties.  These will differ from what is expected based on the `calc()` expression.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.css` file provides a corrected approach, avoiding the pitfalls of the original code.  Details on the solution are provided in the comments within that file.
